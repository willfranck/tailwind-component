Float UI is a collection of modern UI components and website templates, built on top of <br/>React/Nextjs with Tailwind CSS, <br/>

## Why Float UI?

First, Float UI is fully free, and open source, you don't need to pay anything to use it, <br/>

the second thing if youâ€™re working on a large project that requires <br/> a high level of UI customization or you find yourself <br/>repeating the same UI patterns across projects, consider creating an internal UI library, <br/>
